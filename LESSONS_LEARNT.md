# Lessons Learnt

- I learnt about Git and GitHub : Powerful tool for collaboration
- I learnt about the GitHub Flow: Cloning, Working, committing, pushing and creating PRs, etc.
- I learnt many Git terms: Branch, Forks, Pull Requests(PRs), Issues.

I do have some questions: I read some concept online - **rebasing**. What is it used for? and are **merge conflicts** always *unavoidable* especially if a project has a lot of contributors?
